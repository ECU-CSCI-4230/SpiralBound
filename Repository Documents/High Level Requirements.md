# High Level Requirements 

## Functional

+ Functional rich-text editor that allows font weight and colorization changes, as well as code-block distinction and unordered/ordered lists
+ Functional section-page design such that a notebook may have sections (i.e. courses) and pages (i.e. a day of notes)

### Study Tool Feature

- Functional flash-card tool that has a section-set setup, where you have sections (i.e. courses) and sets of flash cards (i.e. one per chapter), with an automated set for all sets to be pulled from

## Optional 

+ Syntax colorization/recognition for a couple of programming languages, with extensibility to others
+ Automated content saving of notes for crash recovery
+ Customization of bulleted graphics (such as you'd find in Microsoft Office, for example)
+ Functional calendar display that shows a preview of the deadlines for the present week or month
+ Weather detection system for the present week, and the saving of that data and updating regularly
+ Notification and classification of upcoming deadlines per section, with toggle-ability of when notifications occur (In the sense of detailed requirements, you'd mention being able to flag some deadlines as important, and set a timeframe such as 'notify 24 hours before due')

### Study Tool Feature

+ Toggleability of flash cards from a set to be blacklisted to offer customization of study sessions (Say you understand certain concepts better than others, and you've made a set of cards for the whole chapter - you can toggle off some of them as you study so they don't reappear to put focus on what you don't know.)
+ Categorization of study cards into objectives or course goals (For example, if you're studying a programming language like Java, you may have a section for syntax and another for typing/type-casting, etc.)
