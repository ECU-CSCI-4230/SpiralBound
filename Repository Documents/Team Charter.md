1. **What are your team’s goals for the collaboration?**

   To complete the project we chose Scrum process with a two week sprint. We plan on having all of the basic features complete halfway through the semester. As for quality, we will be focusing on functionality over form.

2. **Who is responsible for each activity? What roles will each member have? **

   We are going to work collaboratively. For tasks we plan to work in pairs. We plan on switching roles when it comes to work submission and presentations.  

3. **What is your timetable for activities?**  

   We want to split the semester by thirds. For the first third, we want to have our skeleton complete. By the second, features should be complete. By the third, we want to make the program aesthetically pleasing. We want to complete individual tasks every two weeks. 

4. **What are your team’s expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?**

   Meetings are mandatory. Meetings can only be missed if the person has a legitimate reason and has contacted us beforehand via Discord. After three unexcused absences, we will report to Professor Hill.  

5. **What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?  What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?**

   Medical, tests, or professional reasons are excusable. Any other excuse is not. 

6. **What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised to the team (deliverable)?**

   They need to notify us ahead of time via Discord.

7. **What are your team’s expectations regarding the quality of team members’ preparation for team meetings and the quality of the deliverables that members bring to the team?**

   We just want effort from every member.  

8. **What are your team’s expectations regarding team members’ ideas, interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding team-member contributions?**

   Being open minded to other member’s ideas. A good attitude with constructive criticism. Expect a response to questions and posts in Discord within the day. 

9. **What methods will be used to keep the team on track?**

   During meetings we will discuss who is doing well and who is not. We plan on holding each other accountable. Any other discussion will be on Discord.
