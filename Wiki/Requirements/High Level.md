## General
- **HFG-01**: There should be a couple of different themes for the user to select, where these themes customize the appearance and display of notes, deadlines, etc.
- **HNG-01**: SpiralBound shouldn't require greater than 512 MB of RAM, and should operate on Windows 7+, macOS, and Linux.
- **HNG-02**: SpiralBound should be a portable application. That is, it should be able to be exported to a flashdrive and run on another computer with a similar operating system.

## Calendar
- **HFC-01**: Functional calendar display that shows a preview of the deadlines for the present week or month
- **HFC-02**: Weather detection system for the present week, and the saving of that data and updating regularly
- **HFC-03**: Notification and classification of upcoming deadlines per section, with toggle-ability of when notifications occur (In the sense of detailed requirements, you'd mention being able to flag some deadlines as important, and set a timeframe such as 'notify 24 hours before due')

## Text Editor
- **HFE-01**: Functional rich-text editor that allows font weight and colorization changes, as well as code-block distinction and unordered/ordered lists
- **HFE-02**: Functional section-page design such that a notebook may have sections (i.e. courses) and pages (i.e. a day of notes)
- **HFE-03**: Syntax colorization/recognition for a couple of programming languages, with extensibility to others
- **HFE-04**: Automated content saving of notes for crash recovery
- **HFE-05**: Customization of bulleted graphics (such as you'd find in Microsoft Office, for example)

## Study Tool (Optional)
- **HFS-01**: Functional flash-card tool that has a section-set setup, where you have sections (i.e. courses) and sets of flash cards (i.e. one per chapter), with an automated set for all sets to be pulled from
- **HFS-02**: Toggleability of flash cards from a set to be blacklisted to offer customization of study sessions (Say you understand certain concepts better than others, and you've made a set of cards for the whole chapter - you can toggle off some of them as you study so they don't reappear to put focus on what you don't know.)
- **HFS-03**: Categorization of study cards into objectives or course goals (For example, if you're studying a programming language like Java, you may have a section for syntax and another for typing/type-casting, etc.)
