## Onboarding
The following procedure should be followed regarding MacOS and Windows 7, 8.1, or 10. You should have a preferred minimum of 4 GB of RAM and a quad-core processor at 2.0 GHz for optimal development. (For best development, use a screen with 1920x1080 screen resolution).

1. Download and install Git CLI (or Git Desktop). Configure username and e-mail using `git config --global user.name <name>` and `git config --global user.email <email>`.
2. Download and install Visual Studio Code and Qt Creator 4.8.2. Use the open-source version of Qt and select only the options above for minimal installation size.
3. Clone the repository using git `git clone <url> -b <branch>`, or download the master branch and use Qt Creator to change branches.

- You'll need to contact someone on the team about getting you into the Discord server, where most communication about the project arises.
