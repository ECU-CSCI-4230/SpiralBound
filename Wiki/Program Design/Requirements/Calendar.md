#### DFC-01 (details HFC-01, HFC-03)
The calendar should display a single month of assignments or pre-scheduled deadlines, with the months scrollable via two directional buttons beside the name of the month. The calendar should display in a block format, with each deadline pre-scheduled a small banner within the respective day's block. Deadlines should be easily removed, marked as complete, and added.

Notification of upcoming deadlines should be toggleable (i.e. when do they occur, and are there some that are important that should receive multiple notifications). Deadlines should also be classified as belonging to a single section of a notebook (or course, for example 'Software Engineering II' versus 'Web Applications').

Optionally, calendar deadlines should be colorized and assignable to the respective class for which it exists.

#### DFC-02 (details HFC-02)
Optionally, the calendar should attempt to collect weather data from an online resource, spanning a week's time from the day of retrieval. This should be done on startup and sequentially every four to six hours. This feature should be toggleable. Weather data for the week should only display on the calendar, with a single day - the present day - showing its weather on the screen during operation
