#### DFS-01 (details HFS-01, HFS-03)
(01) The flash-card utility should be fully functional, and consist of a series of decks that the user may create; however, there must be one automatically-generated deck that accumulates the cards of all the present decks in the system. Cards should consist of a front and back for studying, and are assignable to only one deck each.

(03) Optionally, cards should be isolatable into their own categories. For example, if you have a course such as CSCI-1010, you may have a section for Java syntax, and another for programmatic concepts.

#### DFS-02 (details HFS-02, HFS-04)
(02) During a study session, flash cards should be able to be _blacklisted_. This means that the card will no longer be presented during the session until the user desires it.

(04) The user should be able to select multiple study decks, or multiple sections from various study decks, such that they may study a variety of concepts at once. Blacklisting of cards should not be preserved for longer than the study session.
